[1;91m[-] [0mWhoops, the target binary crashed suddenly, before receiving any input
    from the fuzzer! You can try the following:

    - The target binary crashes because necessary runtime conditions it needs
      are not met. Try to:
      1. Run again with AFL_DEBUG=1 set and check the output of the target
         binary for clues.
      2. Run again with AFL_DEBUG=1 and 'ulimit -c unlimited' and analyze the
         generated core dump.

    - The current memory limit (1.95 GB) is too restrictive, causing the
      target to hit an OOM condition in the dynamic linker. Try bumping up
      the limit with the -m setting in the command line. A simple way confirm
      this diagnosis would be:

      ( ulimit -Sd $[1999 << 10]; /path/to/fuzzed_app )

      Tip: you can use https://jwilk.net/software/recidivm to
      estimate the required amount of virtual memory for the binary.

    - Possibly the target requires a huge coverage map and has CTORS.
      Retry with setting AFL_MAP_SIZE=10000000.

    - Less likely, there is a horrible bug in the fuzzer. If other options
      fail, poke <afl-users@googlegroups.com> for troubleshooting tips.
